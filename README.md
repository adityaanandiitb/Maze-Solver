# Maze-Solver
1. This project is for a maze solver bot.
2. The problem statement has specific constrains for the bot to follow
3. We will be using LSR algorithm for this project, i.e. the bot first take left if possible then straight then right
4. Key Points:  
 •  Built a PID-based line-following bot that explore a maze in dry run, mapping all directions at each intersections      return
 • Integrated Arduino Nano, Motor Driver and LDR sensor into a PCB to minimize weight and boost speed     return
 • Implemented an algorithm for the bot to follow the shortest path and reach the end of the maze during the 2nd run     return
